# FASTAutonomousAttendance
A system that will help the teachers avoid the paper work and human effort at FAST NUCES. The system will, with the help of images taken though camera installed in class rooms, identify the students entering the room. To keep things simple and realistic, we will avoid the much technical details of deep learning, and to that end will use some built in python libraries (tensor flow, face recognition to be specific). The system will use pre-captured images of students to learn how they look, using a deep neural network (DNN). During execution of system, it will use the learned features from the neural network to recognize the studentâ€™s face accurately.  As the core of this system is facial recognition, our first challenge would be make a network that spots students faces with higher accuracy. Once such system is built, we will add the peripheral features like warning the students when their attendance is failing to meet minimum attendance requirement. Further, the system will allow teachers to show attendance record of students with just a click.
